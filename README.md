# Porfolio

This portfolio showcases my work so far. Using Bootstrap's components and grid system, I am able to create a web application that can be rendered well on any device. On my 'About' link, you will find a short description about myself as well as a link to my resume. On my 'Portfolio' link you'll find links to projects I have worked on, and on my 'Contact' link you'll see my links to my LinkedIn and GitHub.

## Feautres

This web application consists of: 
 - Navbar 
 - Sticky footer
 - Responsive layout.
