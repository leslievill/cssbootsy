# CSS & Bootstrap (or cssbootsy for short)

This portfolio allows me to put the skills I have been taught to the test! Using Bootstrap's components and grid system, I am able to create a web application that can be rendered well on any device. On my 'About' link, you will find a short description about myself, on my 'Portfolio' link you'll find place holder images, and on my 'Contact' link, a short form to fill out.

## Feautres

This web application consists of: 
 - Navbar 
 - Sticky footer
 - Responsive layout.
